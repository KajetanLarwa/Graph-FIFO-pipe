# Graph-FIFO-pipe
C multi process program, that simulates directed graph. There is supervisor process and children processes which correspond to the vertices of the graph. Every vertex has own pipe. Program enables to print all connections, add new edge and check if there is connection between two vertices (not necessarily direct).
